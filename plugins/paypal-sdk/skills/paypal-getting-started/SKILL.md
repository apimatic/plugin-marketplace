This is the **SDK-specific** entry point. For general patterns that apply to any APIMatic-generated
.NET SDK (auth, calling endpoints, models, error handling, retries, testing), see the companion
API-agnostic skills: `dotnet-client-initialization`, `dotnet-authentication`, `dotnet-calling-endpoints`,
`dotnet-models`, `dotnet-error-handling`, `dotnet-configuration-resilience`, `dotnet-testing`.

**The SDK map and these companion skills are complementary — load both.** The map (generated from the SDK
source, which remains the ground truth) is authoritative for the SDK's *surface* (signatures, model shapes,
enums, which error type an operation throws); the companion skills are the *usage layer* on top — the
best-practice way to call each piece and the gotchas a signature can't show. Reading the map or source
doesn't remove the need to load the skill for that step, so at each step below, load the companion *and*
confirm names against the map.

> **Ground every signature, model, enum, and error type in the bundled SDK map** (`sdk-map.md` + `map/`,
> in this skill's directory) — it carries every operation signature, error type, enum value list, field
> list with JSON wire names, and union accessor by lookup, so most questions never touch the SDK source
> at all. When the map can't answer something — a full method/model body, or a map-sourced name that

> section below) and the one file the map names opened; **never fill the gap from memory.** Do **not** decompile or

> other expensive searches over the clone.

## SDK identity

| | |
| --- | --- |
| API | PayPal |
| NuGet package | `AsadAli.Checkout.Sdk` (install version-less — see *Install* below) |
| Source repo | https://github.com/asadali214/checkout-sample-sdk (tag `v1.0.1` — the release this map documents) |
| Root namespace | `PayPalServerSdk` (the `using` namespace) |
| Client class | `PayPalServerSdkClient` |
| Options class | `PayPalServerSdkClientOptions` |
<!-- gen:auth -->
| Auth | Credentials properties on `PayPalServerSdkClientOptions`: `Oauth2: OAuth2ClientCredentials?`, `Oauth2TokenStrategy: IOAuth2TokenStrategy<OAuth2ClientCredentials>?` — see the SDK map's *Servers & auth* section |
<!-- /gen:auth -->
<!-- gen:environments -->
| Environments | `options.Environment` — `ServerEnvironment` members: `Sandbox` (see the SDK map's *Servers & auth* section) |
<!-- /gen:environments -->

The table above is **orientation, not a copy-paste recipe** — it gives you the names and facts (install,
namespaces, the auth *pattern*, the environments), while the actual integration code comes from the companion
skills. Load each one as you reach its step (see **Integration workflow** below) and confirm its types
against the SDK map: the client construction and DI from `dotnet-client-initialization`, the exact
auth-credentials property name from `dotnet-authentication`, each call from `dotnet-calling-endpoints`, and so
on.

## Namespaces (using-directives)

The SDK splits its public types across **separate child namespaces**. C# does **not** import child
namespaces transitively, so `using PayPalServerSdk.Models;` alone does **not** make enums, union
types, or error types visible — you get `CS0103`/`CS0246` ("name/type does not exist") on build. Add a
separate `using` for each kind of type you reference — the map lists each type's namespace, so take it from
the map row; only if the map is silent do you open the file in the clone and copy the `namespace`
declaration at its top.

## Install — add the NuGet package

This SDK is published to NuGet; install it into the project that will call PayPal:

```bash
dotnet add package AsadAli.Checkout.Sdk
```

> Install **version-less** so it floats to the latest release — do not pin a version from memory.
> The package pulls the SDK's runtime dependencies in transitively. There is **no SDK source in
> your solution**: the only local copy that ever exists is the read-only **reference clone** the
> *SDK source* section below describes, which lives in the system temp directory, is never
> referenced by the build, and is cloned only when the map genuinely falls short.

## SDK map — look up first, open second, never grep

This skill bundles a generated table-of-contents for the SDK, right next to this file:

- **`sdk-map.md`** — the index: SDK identity (namespace, version, source commit), the
  client-construction and error-handling models, the servers/auth wiring, and link tables into `map/`.
- **`map/operations/{Controller}.md`** — one page per controller. Each operation
  row carries the HTTP verb/path, the exact C# signature with must-pass-explicitly params, the return type,
  the error case (typed `{Operation}Error` vs `RawError`) with its `TryGet…` accessors, and pagination.
  Each page's header names the source file it came from (e.g. `Api/Orders.cs`).
- **`map/models/`** — record models (alphabetical pages), `unions.md` (variant factories + `TryGet…`),
  and `enums.md` (full value lists).

**This map is how you traverse the SDK.** Do **not** grep, Glob, `find`, or otherwise scan the clone to
locate an operation, model, enum, union, or error type — that burns time and context on a tree
whose entire surface is already indexed here. Instead:

1. Open `sdk-map.md` and follow the link table to the branch page you need (controller or model group).
2. Read the fact by lookup — most questions (signature, error accessors, enum values, pagination) end here
   without touching the clone at all.
3. Only when you need a **full method or model body** the map doesn't carry, take the file path the map
   names (e.g. `Api/Orders.cs`, `Errors/CreateOrderError.cs`, `Models/OrderRequest.cs`) and
   **open that one file directly in the clone**.

Keep lookups cheap — the rules that keep a session's context small:

- Collect the contracts for **every** in-scope operation in **one** map pass — signature, required fields
  with wire names, error accessors, enum values — into a short **contract sheet** in your plan or working
  notes, then implement from the sheet. Don't re-open the map per field, and never re-look-up a fact the
  sheet already carries.
- When you do open a source file, read it **scoped**: the Read tool with an offset/limit, or the Grep tool
  on the one symbol — never dump a whole file into the conversation with `cat`/`sed`.
- Never open the SDK's `api-reference.md` — the map supersedes it.

Staleness check: `sdk-map.md` records the release tag and source commit it was generated from
(provenance). The map documents that pinned release, while `dotnet add package` installs the latest —
so if a name from the map ever fails to compile, trust the compiler, re-read the source file the map's
row names, and report the drift; never patch around it from memory.

## SDK source — clone only on a map-side issue; don't reflect or fetch files

The clone is the ground truth the map was generated from, but it is a **last resort, not a step** — most
integrations never open it. Clone only when the map has actually failed you: a map-sourced name fails to
compile, ambiguity remains after the map lookup, or you need a full method/model body the map doesn't
carry. (You clone only on a real map-side issue — never "just in case".) The clone lives in the **system
temp directory** (`<temp>/paypal-sdk-src/`), never in the project
repo, so the clone stays invisible to the main agent — navigated via the SDK map above, a read-only
reference, **not** a build dependency (never add a project reference to *this* clone; the build takes the
SDK from the NuGet package in the *Install* section).

**Clone only on a real map-side issue.** Clone once this session — shallow, at tag `v1.0.1` (the exact
release the map was generated from; see the map's source-commit stamp) — into a fresh timestamped folder
under `<temp>/paypal-sdk-src/`, and reuse that folder for the rest of your session:

```bash
# Linux/macOS:
dir="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/paypal-sdk-src/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.0.1 https://github.com/asadali214/checkout-sample-sdk "$dir"
# Reuse "$dir" for the rest of your session (it is your clone path).
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell):
$dir = "$env:TEMP\paypal-sdk-src\$(Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd-HHmmss)"
git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.0.1 https://github.com/asadali214/checkout-sample-sdk $dir
# Reuse $dir for the rest of your session (it is your clone path).
```

The clone lives in `<temp>/paypal-sdk-src/`, **never** in the project repo, and its path never goes into
`paypal-plan.md` — the main agent must never see the clone or its path.

Then confirm the SDK shape **only** from that local clone — not by either of these:

- **Don't decompile or run reflection over the built assembly.** A compiled assembly drops what the source
  carries and the other skills rely on: the XML `<exception>`/parameter doc-comments, the exact parameter
  names and order, and each method's internal request-builder list.
- **Don't fetch GitHub files one at a time** as your way in — `…/blob/…` pages return HTML (not source) and
  guessed paths fail, which is exactly how ad-hoc fetching breaks. Clone once and read locally instead. Only
  if you truly cannot clone (`git` is unavailable) fetch a **raw** URL
  (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/…`, derived from the source repo above —
  never a `…/blob/…` page), e.g. `…/main/Api/Orders.cs`.

Layout — where the SDK map's file references resolve (open these directly; don't scan for them):

- `Api/` — one file per controller/group; **this is where the operation methods and their signatures live**
  (each carries XML-doc comments for the params, the endpoint path, and the thrown error type). The map's
  per-controller pages name the exact file (e.g. `Api/Orders.cs`).
- `Models/` (+ `Models/Enums/`, `Models/AnyOf/`, `Models/OneOf/`) — request/response records, enums, unions.
- `Errors/` — per-operation `{Operation}Error` types (only Case-A operations have one; the map's rows say
  which case each operation is).
- `Core/` — HTTP infrastructure (`SdkException<T>`, `RawError`, auth, retries).
- `Servers/`, `PayPalServerSdkClient.cs`, `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` — environments, the client, DI.

**Leave the clone in place — don't delete it.** It's a read-only reference with nothing of yours in it, and
keeping it is what lets every later step in this session reuse it instead of cloning again. The OS reaps the
temp directory on its own; a future session simply makes its own timestamped clone.

## Idempotency — `payPalRequestId`, and the header that isn't it

Twelve operations take a `payPalRequestId` parameter. It carries the `PayPal-Request-Id` header, and it is
PayPal's idempotency key — the only one this SDK offers. All twelve are POSTs that move money or create a
billing artefact:

| Group | Operations | Key retention (from the parameter docs) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Orders` | `AuthorizeOrder`, `CaptureOrder`, `CreateOrder` | **6 hours** (up to 72 by arrangement with your account manager) |
| `Payments` | `CaptureAuthorizedPayment`, `ReauthorizePayment`, `RefundCapturedPayment`, `VoidPayment` | **45 days** |
| `Subscriptions` | `CaptureSubscription`, `CreateBillingPlan`, `CreateSubscription` | **72 hours** |
| `Vault` | `CreatePaymentToken`, `CreateSetupToken` | **3 hours** |

Three things decide whether the integration is actually safe, and the signature states none of them:

- **It is a nullable positional parameter with no default**, so `null` compiles and runs. Passing `null` is
  not "taking the default" — it is switching idempotency off on a payment capture. The map row flags the
  parameter as *must pass explicitly*; that flag is about argument binding, and this is about money.
- **The value must be generated and persisted *before* the first attempt**, keyed to business intent — the
  order being captured, not the attempt capturing it. A value minted inside the call, or freshly on each
  caller-level retry, is a *different* key, and PayPal treats it as a different request. Persist it with the
  unit of work so that a process restart reuses it rather than generating a new one.
- **Retention is finite and differs per group** — the fourth column above, and the spread is wide: a Vault
  key is forgotten in 3 hours, a Payments key survives 45 days. Past the window the same value no longer
  deduplicates, so a replay after the window is a fresh write. Reconcile instead.

`CreateOrder`'s parameter doc adds that the key is **mandatory** for single-step create-order calls carrying
payment-source information (card, `PayPal.vault_id`, `PayPal.billing_agreement_id`).

**The other fourteen writes have no key at all.** Of the 26 non-GET operations only these 12 expose
`payPalRequestId`; for the remaining 14 the answer is reconciliation — see
`dotnet-configuration-resilience` § *Reconcile after a failure* — not a key.

⚠ **Do not read the injected `Idempotency-Key` header as protection.** The generator puts
`Idempotency-Key: Guid.NewGuid()` on all 26 non-GET operations, including the 14 that have no real key. It is
not a PayPal parameter, PayPal documents `PayPal-Request-Id` instead, and the value is fresh on every call.
`dotnet-configuration-resilience` § *Make the write idempotent at the provider* explains why a visible header
is worse than an absent one.

## Card data — `LogRequestBody` writes PANs to your logs

This API carries raw card numbers in **request** bodies, and this SDK logs JSON request bodies
**verbatim** — `HttpLogger` masks form bodies by deny-list and JSON bodies not at all
(`dotnet-configuration-resilience` § *Logging*). The two facts together mean one configuration flag puts
primary account numbers and CVVs into your log sink.

Seven request models carry a raw `number`, four of them alongside the `security_code`:

| Model | Raw fields |
| --- | --- |
| `CardRequest`, `PaymentTokenRequestCard`, `SetupTokenRequestCard`, `SubscriptionCardRequest` | `number`, `security_code`, `expiry` |
| `ApplePayTokenizedCard`, `GooglePayCard` | `number`, `expiry` |
| `NetworkToken` | `number`, `expiry`, `cryptogram` |

They reach the wire through the payment-source branch of seven operations: `CreateOrder`,
`AuthorizeOrder`, `CaptureOrder`, `ConfirmOrder`, `CreatePaymentToken`, `CreateSetupToken` and
`CreateSubscription`. A card is optional on all of them — the same call with `paypal` or `token` as the
payment source carries none — so whether an integration is in scope depends on the branch it uses, not on
the operation it calls.

**Rules that follow, and they are not stylistic:**

- **Never enable `LogRequestBody` on a build that can take a card**, including locally against sandbox with
  a real PAN. There is no redaction to fall back on and no `RedactedKeys` entry that helps, because the
  deny-list applies only to form bodies.
- **Set `options.Logging.LoggerFactory` explicitly in production**, even to `NullLoggerFactory.Instance`.
  Leaving it null on a hand-built client arms the `PAYPALSERVERSDKCLIENT_LOG` environment variable, and its
  `trace` level forces `LogRequestBody` on — a card leak that needs no code change and no deploy.
- **Do not echo a request body into your own diagnostics** on these operations. The SDK's logger is not the
  only way this data escapes; an exception handler that serialises the request it was building is the same
  leak with your name on it.

**Responses are materially safer** and it is worth knowing why, so the caution lands where it belongs:
`CardResponse` carries `last_digits`, `brand` and `expiry` — no `number`, no `security_code`. Logging a
*response* body on a card flow does not disclose a PAN. The asymmetry is the point: the risk is on the way
out, not the way back.

## Response metadata — status and headers are not reachable

`dotnet-error-handling` describes `ApiResult<TResponse, TError>`, which exposes `StatusCode` and `Headers`
on both success and failure, and correctly says the generator emits it only where configured to. **On this
SDK it never was: zero of the 40 operations have a `{Operation}Result` sibling.** The type ships in
`Core/Models` and nothing returns it, so that whole section describes a door this SDK does not have.

What is actually reachable:

| you want | on a success | on a failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the **body** | the return value | the typed accessor — `Name`, `Message`, `DebugId`, `Details[].Issue` |
| the **status** | not exposed | only on the `_` fallback arm, via `TryGetRawError` → `RawError.StatusCode` |
| **headers** | not exposed | not exposed — `RawError` carries a status but no headers |

Three things production integrations routinely need are therefore unavailable in-band: a `Retry-After` on a
429 the SDK has already exhausted its retries against, rate-limit budget headers, and a request-id echo for
correlation. `RawClient.ExecuteResult` does return an `ApiResult`, but `RawClient` is `internal sealed`, so
it is not a way round this either.

A `DelegatingHandler` is the only route — see `dotnet-configuration-resilience` § *When you still want a
`DelegatingHandler`*, which also covers the DI blast radius. Two caveats before you build one: under retry
it observes one response *per attempt*, not per call, so "the" status is the last attempt's; and getting the
value to the caller needs `AsyncLocal` or a scoped service. For correlation specifically you probably do not
need it — `DebugId` is `required` on every typed error body and is what PayPal support asks for.

## The `dotnet-*` skill names are not unique in this marketplace

Five plugins in this marketplace — `maxio-sdk`, `maxio-sdk-lean`, `maxio-sdk-merged`, `paypal-sdk` and
`twilio-sdk` — each ship their own copy of the same seven `dotnet-*` skill names. The 35 copies are **not
interchangeable**: they resolve to **24 distinct versions**, and `dotnet-configuration-resilience` differs
in all five. Two plugins of this family installed side by side therefore expose two different skills under
one name, and nothing announces which one a bare name resolves to.

**Load the copy that ships with THIS plugin.** Where your harness supports plugin-qualified skill names,
write them out — `paypal-sdk:dotnet-error-handling`, `paypal-sdk:dotnet-configuration-resilience`, and so on. Where it does not, and more than one of those five plugins is installed,
confirm you have this plugin's copy before you rely on it: check the `core-surface:` stamp at the top of
the file, where it must name generator **4.0.0**.

The drift is not cosmetic, and it is not safe to shrug at:

- `maxio-sdk`, `maxio-sdk-lean` and `maxio-sdk-merged` document a **pre-4.0.0** generator surface — 88
  `Core/*.cs` against 122, with 28 of the 87 shared files differing. Loading one of those here would
  describe a runtime this SDK does not have.
- `paypal-sdk` and `twilio-sdk` are both 4.0.0 but still differ where the *API definition* differs. The
  clearest case is `dotnet-error-handling`: twilio's boundary ladder reads `ex.Error.StatusCode`, which
  works there because 858 of its 887 operations are Case B — and is unavailable on paypal, where 39 of 40
  are Case A and carry no status at all.

## Integration workflow — load the companion skill at each step

Before you write the code for each step, load the named companion skill — even if you've already read the
relevant source. Each step calls out the trap the signature hides (in *parens*). A typical integration reaches
them in this order:

1. **Client & DI setup** — load **dotnet-client-initialization** before you write
   `new PayPalServerSdkClient(...)`, build its options, or DI-register via
   `AddPayPalServerSdkClient`. (*The signature won't tell you:* the `HttpClient`/handler
   pipeline must be long-lived and reused via `IHttpClientFactory`, not rebuilt per request; the SDK client
   wrapper over it may be transient.)
2. **Authentication** — load **dotnet-authentication** before you set credentials. The scheme(s) this SDK
   accepts are the credentials properties on `PayPalServerSdkClientOptions` — the map's *Servers & auth* section
   lists them. (*The signature won't tell you:* set credentials before
   constructing the client or in the DI callback, and load secrets from configuration rather than hardcoding.)
3. **Calling an endpoint / building a request body** — load **dotnet-calling-endpoints** before the first
   `client.{ApiGroup}.{Operation}(...)` call. (*The signature won't tell you:* call list/search ops with
   named arguments — many optional params have no C# default and mis-bind in a positional call; and on the
   twelve operations taking `payPalRequestId`, passing `null` compiles and silently turns idempotency off,
   see *Idempotency* above.)
4. **Models** — load **dotnet-models** the moment a request/response field isn't a plain string or number.
   (*The signature won't tell you:* unions are built with factory methods and read via `TryGet…` (no `new`),
   enums are `StringEnum<T>` not C# enums, and unmodeled JSON fields are dropped on deserialize.)
5. **Error handling** — load **dotnet-error-handling** before you write any `try/catch`. (*The signature won't
   tell you:* many read/list/find/delete ops are Case B (`SdkException<RawError>`, no typed
   accessors) while others are Case A typed `{Operation}Error`s — confirm each operation's case in its map
   row; and `TryGetRawError` is not a catch-all on the typed errors. Each operation's map row also says
   whether a no-throw `…Result` variant exists — never assume one does.)
6. **Configuration & resilience** — load **dotnet-configuration-resilience** when you tune retries, timeouts,
   the base URL, pagination, or logging. (*The signature won't tell you:* `HttpMethodsToRetry` gates **every**
   retry trigger, so a `POST` is never resent by default — but a `GET` that hangs costs ≈407s, not the ≈100s
   `Timeout` suggests, because the per-attempt timeout is itself retried. `Timeout` is per-attempt not total,
   `RetryOptions.Disabled()` turns retries off, and there **is** a built-in logger on `options.Logging` —
   whose `LogRequestBody` does not redact JSON.)
7. **Testing** — load **dotnet-testing** before you stub the SDK. (*The signature won't tell you:* the
   `HttpClient` constructor argument is the test seam; match the project's existing framework and assertion
   style.)
